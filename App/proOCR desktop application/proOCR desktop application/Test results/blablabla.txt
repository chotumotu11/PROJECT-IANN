What is a paragraph?
Aparagraph is a group of sentences about one
main idea. It can be short or long, depending on
if the topic or idea you have been covering has
been fully explored in that paragraph.AIthough is
recommended that the paragraph is no longer
than 10 lines.
Once you feel happy that you have nothing
further to say on that particular subject, you
should move on to a new paragraph.
